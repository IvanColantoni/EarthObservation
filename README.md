# EarthObservation
Here there are 3 reports I made in the field of Earth Observation Data Analysis. The topics are:
- **HW1 Remote Sensing of Vegetation from MODIS**:  
*Explore Sentinel-1 SAR data for estimating vegetation cover, inland water, chlorophyll-a sea concentration and supervised classification within a region of interested (ROI)*

- **HW2 Surface Mapping from MSI Sentinel-2 Data**:  
*Explore Sentinel-2 MSI data for estimating vegetation cover, inland water, chlorophyll-asea concentration and supervised classification within a region of interested (ROI)*
- **HW3 Surface Detection from SAR Sentinel-1 data**:  
*Explore Sentinel-1 SAR data for earthquake detection by SAR differential interferometry, ship and flood detection by SAR backscattering.*
